Midterm Concept:
Re-imagination of Water Lilies from Monet and Starry Night Over the Rhone from Van Gogh 

Water Lilies is one of my favorite painting series and I decided to recreate it in a digital way.
I created water ripples and simulated the sparkling pond in a raining day.
Also applied the effect to other artwork.
